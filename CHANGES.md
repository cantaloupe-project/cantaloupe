# Change Log

## 5.0

### Endpoints

* A `cache=recache` URL query argument is available that reprocesses and
  recaches the derivative image before delivering it.
* The `X-IIIF-ID` reverse proxy header is no longer supported. `X-Forwarded-ID`
  should be used instead.
* The `response-content-disposition` URL query argument supports RFC 6266
  Unicode filename syntax.
* The `endpoint.iiif.content_disposition` configuration key has been removed.
  The `response-content-disposition` URL query argument should be used instead.
* The IIIF Image API 1.x endpoint no longer supports content negotiation. If a
  format extension is not supplied in the URI, JPEG will be returned regardless
  of the value of the `Accept` header.
* The `http.http2.enabled` and `https.http2.enabled` configuration keys have
  been removed. HTTP/2 is always enabled.
* A `scale_constraints.delimiter` configuration key is available for customizing
  the character sequence used to separate scale constraints from identifiers in
  URIs.

### Sources

* Sources support inconsistencies between filename/identifier extensions and
  byte signatures.
* HttpSource uses the OkHttp HTTP client library instead of Jetty.
* HttpSource supports HTTP/2.

### Processors

* ImageMagickProcessor, GraphicsMagickProcessor, and KakaduDemoProcessor have
  been removed.
* The metadata-handling system has been redesigned:
    * Source image metadata is cached in derivative caches.
    * XMP metadata can be copied or edited using a delegate method.
    * The `processor.metadata.respect_orientation` configuration key has been
      removed and EXIF Orientation values are always respected.
* KakaduNativeProcessor, OpenJpegProcessor, and TurboJpegProcessor respect the
  EXIF `Orientation` tag.
* KakaduNativeProcessor and OpenJpegProcessor support IPTC and XMP metadata.
* TurboJpegProcessor supports EXIF, IPTC, and XMP metadata.
* Java2dProcessor supports the XPM source format.
* FfmpegProcessor, KakaduNativeProcessor, OpenJpegProcessor, and
  PdfBoxProcessor use libjpeg-turbo to write JPEGs if it is available.
* Added the `scaled` position for image overlays.

### Caches

* Added DynamoDBCache.

### Other

  AbstractIIOImageReader methods resulting from improper exception handling.
* Improved the user-friendliness of error messages resulting from illegal
  quality and format arguments in image requests.
* Reduced an error-level log statement resulting from an exception while
  streaming from a derivative cache to the response to debug-level.
* Jetty has been upgraded to version 9.4.24.v20191120, which addresses
  multiple CVEs.

## 4.1.4

* Fixed the health-check endpoint (at `/health`).
* Fixed error responses when encountering empty request headers. (Thanks to
  @RRMoelker)
* Fixed incorrect URIs in `Link` header values in certain IIIF Image API v2
  image endpoint responses.
* The `?response-content-disposition` query argument correctly handles
  filenames containing spaces.
* Image endpoints return HTTP 403 instead of 500 in response to
  AccessDeniedExceptions from the underlying Source.
* Fixed two separate bugs in KakaduNativeProcessor that both caused empty
  regions to appear in certain images.
* Fixed overly restrictive signature verification in KakaduDemoProcessor and
  OpenJpegProcessor that could cause errors with some valid images.
* Fixed TurboJpegProcessor not respecting the `processor.background_color`
  configuration key.
* Fixed the `PurgeItemFromCache` API method not working with S3Cache and
  AzureStorageCache.
* When using `AutomaticSelectionStrategy`, processor initialization errors are
  logged at debug-level rather than error-level.

## 4.1.3

* Added an undocumented `HttpSource2` source which works the same as
  `HttpSource`, and uses the same configuration keys and delegate method, but
  is backed by a different HTTP client library. If you are having problems with
  `HttpSource`, try this one instead. The current implementation of
  `HttpSource` will probably be replaced by this one in the next major version.
* Fixed a missing `resulting_size` key in the delegate script's `options` hash,
  introduced in 4.1.

  containing a `filename` argument.
* Fixed failing to source-cache non-selectively-readable images when using
  Java2dProcessor or JaiProcessor with the source cache enabled and a source
  for which chunking is enabled.
* The Jetty client used by HttpSource has been downgraded to the version used
  in 4.1.1 due to a bug in the version used in 4.1.2.

  available.
* Fixed a potential IIOException when reading certain JPEG images with
  JaiProcessor.
* Fixed newlines (`\n`) appearing literally in string overlays.
* Updated the Jetty dependency to address the following security vulnerability:
  CVE-2019-10247.

## 4.1

### Configuration

* Configuration values can be obtained from the environment. See the user
  manual for more information.

### Endpoints

* The `redirect()` and `authorized?()` delegate methods have been merged into a
  new `authorize()` method, which enables a superset of their functionality,
  including challenge responses and redirects to "virtual" quality-limited
  versions. Authorization can also be set up to align with the IIIF
  Authentication API 1.0's "all or nothing access" or "tiered access" schemes.
* The `endpoint.public.auth.*` keys that controlled global HTTP Basic
  protection have also been replaced by the `authorize()` delegate method.
* The maximum allowed scale can set in the configuration.
* Running tasks are displayed in the Control Panel.
* Added HTTP API endpoints for status and health checks.
* In the IIIF Image API 2.x endpoint, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
  response header is always included in the information response regardless of
  whether an `Origin` header was sent in the request, in order to align more
  closely with the IIIF Image API.
* Improved handling and documentation of the `X-Forwarded-Port` header.
* The `/iiif` URI path no longer redirects to a specific Image API version, and
  now returns HTTP 404.
* Bug fixes related to cropping-by-percent of EXIF-rotated images.
* During image requests, `authorize()` is called earlier in the setup process,
  for better efficiency.
* Removed the Restlet dependency.

### Sources

* HttpSource, S3Source, and AzureStorageSource are able to request chunks of
  resources on demand, which can improve performance when reading images in
  selectively-readable encodings like JPEG2000 and multi-resolution TIFF.
* HttpSource sends initial `HEAD` requests instead of ranged `GET` requests.
* The hash returned from the `httpsource_resource_info()` delegate method may
  include custom request headers.
* HttpSource's `HttpSource.trust_invalid_certs` configuration key has been
  renamed `HttpSource.allow_insecure`. When enabled, insecure cipher suites are
  accepted as well as insecure certificates.
* S3Source uses a Minio client instead of the AWS Java SDK client, to work
  around a possible thread-starvation bug in the AWS Java SDK when S3Source
  and S3Cache are in use at the same time.

### Processors

* Added configurable processor selection strategies, one of which uses the
  existing `processor.*` configuration keys, and the other of which uses an
  automatic strategy that attempts to choose a "best" processor on a per-
  request basis.
* Added TurboJpegProcessor.
* Added the `repeat` position for image overlays.
* Efficiency improvements in KakaduNativeProcessor.
* KakaduNativeProcessor supports `sizeByDistortedWidthHeight`.
* Java2dProcessor and PdfBoxProcessor can preserve XMP metadata across most
  source and output formats.
* KakaduNativeProcessor respects the `processor.metadata.preserve`
  configuration key for XMP metadata.
* Worked around a bug in the GraphicsMagick `gm` command that causes occasional
  "broken pipe" errors from GraphicsMagickProcessor when reading images from a
  FileSource.
* KakaduDemoProcessor has been deprecated, as it has been made more-or-less
  redundant by KakaduNativeProcessor.
* Updated the PDFBox dependency.
* Removed normalization.

### Caches

* S3Cache uses last-accessed rather than last-modified times.
* Changed the S3Cache and AzureStorageCache key naming schemes to improve
  organization and avoid problems with edge cases.

### Other

* The change log has moved from the website to this file.
* Java 11 is supported.

## 4.0.3

* Fixed a scaling-related regression in PdfBoxProcessor.
* Streams consumed from S3Source are drained fully before closure, which makes
  its connection pool more efficient and fixes a warning-level error message
  from its internal HTTP client.
* Fixed inability to use `ScriptLookupStrategy` with AzureStorageSource.
  (Thanks to @marc-sensenich)
* Fixed a potential math error when cropping certain images with an embedded
  EXIF Orientation tag.
* Improved exception handling in S3Source and S3Cache.
* Fixed inability of S3Cache and AzureStorageCache to recognize a
  `cache.server.derivative.ttl_seconds` key value greater than 2^31.

  when reading certain images from the source cache.
* Corrected the `gray` quality to `grey` in the IIIF Image API 1.x endpoint.
* Updated the Tika dependency to address the following security vulnerability:
  CVE-2018-17197.

  attempting to scale a source image that is natively less than three pixels in
  either dimension, or has been cropped to that size.
* Fixed an empty response when image overlays are enabled but the overlay
  pathname or URL is invalid. Instead, images are served without the overlay,
  and warnings logged.
* Updated Jetty to version 9.4.12, which fixes a potential connection leak in
  long-running servers when using HttpSource. (Thanks to @giancarlobi)
* Miscellaneous other dependency updates.

## 4.0.1

* Fixed a regression introduced in 3.4.3 that could cause URIs to appear with
  the wrong scheme in information responses and `Link` headers. (Thanks to
  @mmatela and @jweisman)
* Fixed a bug that caused the minimum tile size in IIIF Image API 2.x
  information responses to be 512 regardless of the setting of
  `endpoint.iiif.min_tile_size`.
* Fixed a connection leak in HttpSource.
* Improved the resiliency of the internal JPEG2000 parser used by
  KakaduDemoProcessor and OpenJpegProcessor.
* Fixed KakaduNativeProcessor's handling of `sizeByDistortedWidthHeight`
  requests.
* Removed an error message that would appear in the log when the delegate
  script file was not found but the delegate script was disabled.
* The `X-Forwarded-Host` reverse proxy header may contain a port number, which
  will be used if `X-Forwarded-Port` is not supplied.

## 4.0

### Endpoints

* A new `X-Forwarded-ID` reverse proxy header replaces `X-IIIF-ID`, which has
  been deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.
* Error response representations are in `text/plain` format in the absence of a
  client preference.
* When `endpoint.iiif.content_disposition` is set to `inline`, the
  `Content-Disposition` header value includes a filename-safe version of the
  image identifier.

### Sources

* Resolvers have been renamed sources to better reflect their core function.
* AmazonS3Resolver has been renamed S3Source, and it now supports non-AWS
  endpoints.
* S3Source supports a configurable path prefix and suffix when using
  `BasicLookupStrategy`.
* AzureStorageSource supports shared access signature (SAS) URIs. (Thanks to
  @ddisciascio)
* Improved the efficiency of source cache content access when
  `cache.server.resolve_first = false`.
* All sources fall back to checking the magic bytes in image data if they
  cannot infer a format any other way.

### Processors

* KakaduProcessor has been renamed KakaduDemoProcessor to reflect the fact that
  it interfaces with the Kakadu demo tool, `kdu_expand`, and not the native
  library.
* Added KakaduNativeProcessor, as well as compiled binaries for Linux, macOS,
  and Windows, which are free to use with it for non-commercial purposes.
* Added `DownloadStrategy` as another optional retrieval strategy for
  stream-based processors, and as an optional fallback strategy. This enables
  all processors to work with all sources with no extra configuration.
* JPEG2000-compatible JPX images are readable by all processors that support
  JPEG2000.
* JaiProcessor has been deprecated. See the user manual for more information.
* KakaduDemoProcessor and OpenJpegProcessor work in Windows.
* KakaduDemoProcessor and OpenJpegProcessor read image metadata using custom
  code, which is more efficient than using the respective `kdu_jp2info` and
  `opj_dump` tools, and enables them to read the number of decomposition
  levels, which improves reliability when decoding images with less-common
  level counts.
* Image I/O plugins can be selected on a per-format basis.
* Improved the efficiency of the Java 2D resample filters.
* When using the Java 2D pipeline to downscale to less than three pixels on a
  side, an empty image with the correct dimensions is returned, rather than a
  downscaled 3×3 image, which is the smallest size that the Java 2D resample
  filters support.
* Java2dProcessor supports animated GIFs.
* Java2dProcessor supports CMYK & YCCK JPEGs.
* Worked around some behavior of the `opj_decompress` tool that could cause
  OpenJpegProcessor to break. (Thanks to @adam-vessey)
* Improved PdfBoxProcessor's validation of requests for multi-page PDFs whose
  pages have inconsistent dimensions.
* The `processor.limit_to_8_bits` configuration option is no longer available.
  All output is limited to 8 bits.
* Disabled support for GIF source images in JaiProcessor, as it was buggy and
  other processors can handle GIF better.

### Caching

* AmazonS3Cache has been renamed S3Cache, and it now supports non-AWS
  endpoints.
* The time-to-live of the source and derivative caches is independently
  configurable.
* The cache worker dumps the contents of HeapCache during its shifts, if both
  are enabled and if HeapCache persistence is also enabled.
* The cache worker's work interval specifies the amount of time between the end
  of one shift and the beginning of the next, rather between the start of one
  shift and the next.
* The deprecated `DELETE /cache/:identifier` HTTP API method has been removed.

### Delegate Script

* The delegate script has been redesigned as a class that is instantiated
  per-request. See the "Delegate Script" section of the user manual for
  detailed information.

### Other

  the wrong scheme in information responses and `Link` headers. (Thanks to
  @mmatela and @jweisman)
* The `X-Forwarded-Host` reverse proxy header may contain a port, which will be
  used if `X-Forwarded-Port` is not supplied.

## 3.4.3

* Updated the Jackson dependency to address the following security
  vulnerabilities: CVE-2018-7489, CVE-2018-5968, CVE-2017-15095.
* AmazonS3Resolver and AmazonS3Cache can obtain credentials from Amazon
  container environment variables or EC2 Instance Metadata Service.
* Arbitrary `X-Forwarded` headers are respected without `X-Forwarded-Host`
  needing to be set. (Thanks to @jweisman)
* Fixed a potential resource leak involving stream-based resolvers.
* Fixed HttpResolver's handling of semicolon-delimited `Content-Type` header
  values.
* Fixed palette corruption when cropping source images with indexed color with
  Java2dProcessor.
* Fixed a `NullPointerException` when using the info cache without a derivative
  cache.
* Other minor fixes.

## 3.4.2

* Fixed a leak when using HttpResolver in a Servlet container that resulted in
  an inability to shut down properly. (Thanks to @punkfairy)

  and GraphicsMagickProcessor.
* Fixed incorrect URIs in responses when using slash substitution or
  URI-encoded identifiers.
* Efficiency improvements in AmazonS3Resolver and AzureStorageResolver.

  the source image is already bitonal or gray. (Thanks to @adam-vessey)
* Fixed upscaling by percent in KakaduProcessor and OpenJpegProcessor.
* Efficiency improvements in PdfBoxProcessor.
* Improved the reliability of source cache downloading and content acquisition.
* Miscellaneous reliability improvements in AmazonS3Resolver and AmazonS3Cache.
* Server misconfigurations cause HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) responses
  rather than HTTP 400 (Bad Request).

## 3.4

### Endpoints

* HTTP/2 can be enabled in standalone mode. (H2 requires Java 9, but H2C works
  in Java 8.)
* The accept queue limit of the standalone HTTP & HTTPS servers is
  configurable.
* The minimum size in IIIF Image API 2.x `info.json` responses is configurable.
  (Thanks to @cbeer)
* The maximum size in IIIF Image API 2.x `info.json` responses is the full
  image size, rather than half size. (Thanks to @cbeer)
* The IIIF Image API 1.x endpoint returns a JPEG image, rather than GIF, when
  no client preference is expressed in the URI or `Accept` header.
* Certain derivative cache errors can be recovered from without causing an error
  response.
* The `sizes` key in Image API 2.x information responses respects the
  `max_pixels` configuration option.

  authentication credentials.
* Added an option to HttpResolver to trust all certificates.
* The request timeout of HttpResolver is configurable.
* AmazonS3Resolver and AzureStorageResolver attempt to infer a source format
  from the object/blob key if not able to do so from the identifier or from
  object/blob metadata.
* The maxmimum number of AWS connections used by AmazonS3Resolver is
  configurable.
* AmazonS3Resolver falls back to obtaining credentials from various other
  sources (see the user manual) when they are not set in the configuration
  file. (Thanks to @jweisman)
* Resolver delegates are passed an additional context parameter. (Thanks to
  @jonathangreen)

  multiple applications that use Image I/O are running in the same container.
  (Thanks to @mmatela)
* Fixed a resource leak when using image overlays.
* Improvements in the testing and build process. (Thanks to @kinow)

## 3.3.2

## 3.3

### Endpoints

* Auto-computed tile sizes of source images with an odd number of pixels in a
  dimension in information responses are rounded up, to prevent clients from
  requesting extremely narrow edge tiles.
* Operations that would have no effect in their context—for example, a crop to
  0,0/300×200, followed by a scale-to-fit to 300 pixels wide—are skipped.

  processors, making them integrate better into the caching architecture.
* Added an auto-normalize option to all image processors.
* Added an option to all processors to output progressive JPEGs.
* Added experimental support for DICOM images to GraphicsMagickProcessor,
  ImageMagickProcessor, Java2dProcessor, and JaiProcessor. (This is a very

  length limit.

### Overlays

* Watermarks have been renamed overlays.
* Added textual overlays.
* Overlay images can be located on the filesystem or an HTTP(S) server.
* Overlay images are cached in memory for better efficiency.

### Delegate Script

* Added an optional delegate method invocation cache.
* Added the ability to redirect to another URL via the `authorized?()` delegate
  method.
* The delegate script is reloaded on change rather than per-request.

## 3.2.4

  requests (`w,h`) as scale-to-fit (`!w,h`).
* Fixed a bug affecting upscaled crops when using pyramidal images with
  Java2dProcessor or JaiProcessor.

  typically involving failure in the underlying storage.
* Fixed a bug that could cause incompletely-written cached images (with any
  cache) to not get cleaned up properly.

## 3.2.2

* Fixed inability to upscale by pixels.
* Fixed an error in response to requests for images less than 3 pixels on a
  side when sharpening is enabled, in all processors using the Java 2D
  pipeline.
* Fixed an error in JaiProcessor when attempting to scale an image less than 3
  pixels on the smallest side.
* Fixed a bug in FilesystemCache that caused zero-byte files to be written and
  an HTTP 500 response when handling concurrent identical requests.
* Error responses include a more appropriate `Cache-Control` header rather than
  the one set in the configuration.
* Trailing slashes in `X-Forwarded-Path` header values are trimmed off,
  preventing double-slashes from appearing in generated URLs.

## 3.2.1

* Fixed a bug that caused the resolver selected by the `get_resolver()`
  delegate method to not be initielized properly.
* Fixed a path-handling bug affecting ImageMagickProcessor and
  GraphicsMagickProcessor primarily in Windows.
* Fixed incorrect image sizes when using FfmpegProcessor with percentage scales
  above 100%.
* Improved support for 16-bit source images in Java2dProcessor, JaiProcessor,
  GraphicsMagickProcessor, and ImageMagickProcessor.

## 3.2

* Java 8 is now required.
* Significant efficiency improvements in the Java 2D processing pipeline
  affecting Java2dProcessor, JaiProcessor, and KakaduProcessor.
* All processors that use the Java 2D pipeline (Java2dProcessor,
  KakaduProcessor, OpenJpegProcessor, PdfBoxProcessor) support selectable
  upscaling and downscaling filters.
* Improved the scale quality of JaiProcessor.
* All processors offer configurable sharpening levels.
* Applicable processors respect source ICC color profiles.
* Added the option to copy EXIF, IPTC IIM, XMP, and/or native TIFF and PNG
  metadata from source images to derivative images of the same format, for
  some processors.
* Java2dProcessor and JaiProcessor respect the value of an embedded EXIF
  Orientation tag.
* Increased the default Java2dProcessor/JaiProcessor JPEG quality to 0.8 (80).
* Added support for a `X-IIIF-ID` request header, in order to return correct
  image identifiers in information responses whose requests have passed through
  a reverse proxy using a different identifier.
* Removed the JAI post-processor option for KakaduProcessor and
  OpenJpegProcessor.
* Zero-byte files are deleted when purging or cleaning FilesystemCache.
* KakaduProcessor and OpenJpegProcessor return a less inscrutable error
  message when they are unable to read a source file.
* HTTP 415 is returned instead of HTTP 400 when an output format is requested
  that is valid but unsupported by the current processor.
* Colorized the console application log.
* Console application log messages with a severity of `WARN` and above are
  routed to standard error.
* Upgraded a number of libraries.

## 3.1.2

* Fixed a resource leak that would cause landing pages, error pages, and the
  Control Panel to become inaccessible after a long time running.
* Fixed a bug where the watermark wouldn't be added if redactions were enabled
  and set to use `DelegateScriptStrategy` but the delegate script was disabled.
* Fixed tile sizes in the IIIF Image API 2.x information response when using
  KakaduProcessor.
* HTTP 400 is returned in response to a request for an image that would be
  zero pixels on a side, even when the zero dimension is not explicit in the
  request. (For example, a size of `4,` for an image that is at least five
  times wider than it is tall.) (Previously, it was only returned when zero
  pixels was explicitly requested, and the image returned for implicit zero
  sizes was incorrect.)

## 3.1.1

* Added the `http.host` and `https.host` standalone mode configuration options,
  defaulting to listen on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces).

## 3.1

* Added support for version 2.1 of the IIIF Image API.
    * Added support for the `square` region parameter to all processors.
    * Added the `max` size parameter.
    * Removed the information request `Link` header for the JSON-LD context.
    * Added the `sizeByConfinedWh` and `sizeByDistortedWh` feature names,
      supported by all processors.
    * Added the `maxArea` property to the profile description, based on the
      value of the `max_pixels` configuration key.
* Replaced the `get_iiif2_service` delegate method with
  `extra_iiif2_information_response_keys`.

## 3.0.1

* Fixed a broken build in standalone mode.

## 3.0

* Added a Control Panel for web-based configuration changes.
* Changed the distribution archive to a custom WAR file that can be run
  standalone (as before) or in a Servlet container.
* Added AmazonS3Cache.
* Added AzureStorageCache.
* Added redaction.
* Added the ability to restrict available sizes to those specified in the
  `info.json` response in the IIIF Image API 2.0 endpoint.
* Added an optional source image cache, which can improve the performance of
  StreamProcessors, as well as enable FileProcessors to work with
  StreamResolvers.
* Moved JdbcResolver delegate methods to the delegate script.
* Moved resolver-related delegate methods to submodules to improve
  organization.
* Changes to the logging configuration are applied immediately without
  restarting.
* Requests for more than `max_pixels` receive an HTTP 403 response rather than
  HTTP 500.
* Upgraded the Amazon S3 client to version 1.10.56.
* Upgraded the Restlet framework to version 2.3.7.
