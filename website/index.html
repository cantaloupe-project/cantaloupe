<h2 id="About">About</h2>

<p>Cantaloupe is a free, open-source image server enabling dynamic delivery of derivatives of high-resolution source images. With available processing operations including cropping, scaling, and rotation, it can support client-side deep-zooming image viewers, as well as on-the-fly thumbnail generation.</p>

<p>Developed at the <a href="http://www.library.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library</a>, Cantaloupe augments an emerging digital repository containing thousands of high-resolution scanned maps and photographs. Project goals include performance, scalability, and extensibility, without sacrificing ease of use.</p>

<p>Cantaloupe can be accessed via a simple REST API, and is compatible with <a href="http://iiif.io/apps-demos.html">a growing number of client applications</a> via its compliance with the <a href="http://iiif.io/api/image/">IIIF Image API</a>.</p>

<p>Cantaloupe features a configurable processing pipeline based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="endpoints.html">Endpoints</a>, that intercept and translate client requests;</li>
  <li><a href="resolvers.html">Resolvers</a>, that locate and retrieve the source images specified in the requests;</li>
  <li><a href="processors.html">Processors</a>, that transform them according to the request parameters; and</li>
  <li><a href="caches.html">Caches</a>, that cache the generated images.</li>
</ul>

<p>This makes it adaptable and future-ready, while remaining easy to configure and use.</p>
