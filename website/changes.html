  <li>Worked around an issue in OpenJPEG that could cause OpenJpegProcessor to fail when reading certain images from the source cache.</li>
  <li>Corrected the <code>gray</code> quality to <code>grey</code> in the IIIF Image API 1.x endpoint.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4.0.2</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The exploded application is more reliably cleaned up at shutdown when running in standalone mode.</li>
  <li>KakaduNativeProcessor supports JPEG2000-compatible JPX source images.</li>

</ul>

<h2>4.0.1</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a regression introduced in 3.4.3 that could cause URIs to appear with the wrong scheme in information responses and <code>Link</code> headers. (Thanks to @mmatela and @jweisman)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that caused the minimum tile size in IIIF Image API 2.x information responses to be 512 regardless of the setting of <code>endpoint.iiif.min_tile_size</code>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>4.0</h2>

<h3>Endpoints</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A new <code>X-Forwarded-ID</code> reverse proxy header replaces <code>X-IIIF-ID</code>, which has been deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.</li>
  <li>Error response representations are in <code>text/plain</code> format in the absence of a client preference.</li>
  <li>When <code>endpoint.iiif.content_disposition</code> is set to <code>inline</code>, the <code>Content-Disposition</code> header value includes a filename-safe version of the image identifier.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sources</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Resolvers have been renamed sources to better reflect their core function.</li>
  <li>AmazonS3Resolver has been renamed S3Source, and it now supports non-AWS endpoints.</li>
  <li>S3Source supports a configurable path prefix and suffix when using <code>BasicLookupStrategy</code>.</li>
  <li>AzureStorageSource supports shared access signature (SAS) URIs. (Thanks to @ddisciascio)</li>
  <li>Improved the efficiency of source cache content access when <code>cache.server.resolve_first = false</code>.</li>
  <li>All sources fall back to checking the magic bytes in image data if they cannot infer a format any other way.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Processors</h3>
<ul>
  <li>KakaduProcessor has been renamed KakaduDemoProcessor to reflect the fact that it interfaces with the Kakadu demo tool, <span class="filename">kdu_expand</span>, and not the native library.</li>
  <li>Added KakaduNativeProcessor, as well as compiled binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows, which are free to use with it for non-commercial purposes.</li>
  <li>Added <code>DownloadStrategy</code> as another optional retrieval strategy for stream-based processors, and as an optional fallback strategy. This enables all processors to work with all sources with no extra configuration.</li>
  <li>JPEG2000-compatible JPX images are readable by all processors that support JPEG2000.</li>
  <li>JaiProcessor has been deprecated. See the user manual for more information.</li>
  <li>KakaduDemoProcessor and OpenJpegProcessor work in Windows.</li>
  <li>KakaduDemoProcessor and OpenJpegProcessor read image metadata using custom code, which is more efficient than using the respective <span class="filename">kdu_jp2info</span> and <span class="filename">opj_dump</span> tools, and enables them to read the number of decomposition levels, which improves reliability when decoding images with less-common level counts.</li>
  <li>Image I/O plugins can be selected on a per-format basis.</li>
  <li>Improved the efficiency of the Java 2D resample filters.</li>
  <li>When using the Java 2D pipeline to downscale to less than three pixels on a side, an empty image with the correct dimensions is returned, rather than a downscaled 3&times;3 image, which is the smallest size that the Java 2D resample filters support.</li>
  <li>Java2dProcessor supports animated GIFs.</li>
  <li>Java2dProcessor supports CMYK &amp; YCCK JPEGs.</li>
  <li>Worked around some behavior of the <span class="filename">opj_decompress</span> tool that could cause OpenJpegProcessor to break. (Thanks to @adam-vessey)</li>
  <li>Improved PdfBoxProcessor's validation of requests for multi-page PDFs whose pages have inconsistent dimensions.</li>
  <li>The <code>processor.limit_to_8_bits</code> configuration option is no longer available. All output is limited to 8 bits.</li>
  <li>Disabled support for GIF source images in JaiProcessor, as it was buggy and other processors can handle GIF better.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Caching</h3>
<ul>
  <li>AmazonS3Cache has been renamed S3Cache, and it now supports non-AWS endpoints.</li>
  <li>The time-to-live of the source and derivative caches is independently configurable.</li>
  <li>The cache worker dumps the contents of HeapCache during its shifts, if both are enabled and if HeapCache persistence is also enabled.</li>
  <li>The cache worker's work interval specifies the amount of time between the end of one shift and the beginning of the next, rather between the start of one shift and the next.</li>
  <li>The deprecated <code>DELETE /cache/:identifier</code> HTTP API method has been removed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Delegate Script</h3>

  <li>The delegate script has been redesigned as a class that is instantiated per-request. See the "Delegate Script" section of the user manual for detailed information.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Java 10 (18.3) is supported.</li>
  <li>Updated JRuby to 9.1.17.0.</li>
