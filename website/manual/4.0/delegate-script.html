<p>The delegate script mechanism enables the use of custom code to customize the image server's behavior. It is designed for ease-of-use, with a simple interface and shallow learning curve. The language in which the code is written&mdash;Ruby&mdash;is easy to learn and work with, and usually, only a small amount of code is needed.</p>

<p>Delegate methods are invoked by a JRuby interpreter bundled into the application. There is no need to install an external Ruby environment and no need to write Java or interact with the application's internal API.</p>

<p>The JRuby interpreter is compatible with Ruby version 2.3.</p>

<h2 id="Enabling">Enabling</h2>

<p>The delegate script is disabled by default. To enable it, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Copy the sample delegate script, <span class="filename">delegates.rb.sample</span>, included in the distribution, to <span class="filename">delegates.rb</span>.</li>
  <li>Reference it from the <code>delegate_script.pathname</code> configuration option.</li>
  <li>Set <code>delegate_script.enabled</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="How It Works">How It Works</h2>

<p>The delegate script is a file containing a delegate class written in Ruby. The class is instantiated per-request, early in the request cycle, and disposed of at the end of the request cycle. At various points in the request cycle, its methods are called by the application to obtain custom information needed to service the request.</p>

<p>Before any other methods are called, the application will set the request context, which is a hash of request properties with perhaps some other helpful information mixed in. See the documentation of the <var>context</var> attribute (<code>attr_accessor :context</code>) in the sample delegate script file for information about the keys that may be present in the context hash.</p>

<p>You can also use code like <code>context.each{ |k,v| puts "#{k}: #{v}" }</code> in any method to print the context to the console.</p>

<h2 id="Migrating">Migrating From the 3.x Script to the 4.x Script</h2>

<p>In version 4, the delegate script was redesigned to address several limitations of the original design. A comparison of the two follows:</p>

<h2 id="Rules">Rules</h2>

<p>All delegate methods must be contained within a <code>CustomDelegate</code> class. Inside a method, anything goes, and you can use any (non-platform-native) gems that you have installed with <code>gem install</code>.</p>

<p>The delegate script is reloaded whenever the script file changes. Be aware, though, that code that has already been loaded into the JRuby runtime cannot be unloaded. For example, when a class is changed, the new version will replace the old version; but constants within the class cannot be redefined.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger">Note: generally, neither method arguments nor return values are sanitized or validated. <strong>Be very careful to write defensive, injection-safe code.</strong></div>

<hr>

<h2 id="Gems">Gems</h2>

<p>JRuby can load most Ruby gems, except those that have been built with native extensions. To import a gem, use the <code>require</code> statement:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'mygem'
{% endhighlight %}

<p><code>require</code> searches for gems based on the <code>$GEM_PATH</code> environment variable, falling back to <code>$GEM_HOME</code> if that is not defined. If JRuby fails to find your gem, check your <code>$GEM_PATH</code>. If you installed the gem using <code>gem install</code>, check the output of <code>gem env</code> (particularly the "gem paths" section) to see where it might have been installed, and ensure that those locations are present in <code>$GEM_PATH</code>.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="Improving Efficiency">Improving Efficiency</h2>

<p>Several delegate methods will be called over the course of a single request, and making them as efficient as possible will improve response times. A couple of techniques for improving efficiency are:</p>

<h3 id="Sharing Information">Sharing Information</h3>

<p>Some methods may need to do similar work. For example, <code>authorized?()</code> and <code>redirect()</code> may have to trigger the same expensive call to an authorization service. To avoid having to do this twice, a useful technique is to cache the result. So, rather than doing this:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
class CustomDelegate
  def redirect(options = {})
    # perform an expensive query and return the result
  end

  def authorized?(options = {})
    # perform an expensive query and return the result
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You could do this:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
class CustomDelegate
  def redirect(options = {})
    result = perform_expensive_query
  end

  def authorized?(options = {})
    result = perform_expensive_query
  end

  # Performs an expensive query only once, caching the result.
  def perform_expensive_query(options = {})
    unless @result
      # perform the query
      @result = ... # save the result in an instance variable
    end
    @result
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="Caching">Caching</h3>

<p>The <code>delegate_script.cache.enabled</code> option is available to cache the results of delegate method invocations. The cache is an in-memory least-recently-used (LRU) cache with infinite time-to-live and a maximum size auto-computed based on the maximum JVM heap size. When the limit is approached, the oldest invocations will be purged automatically.</p>

<p>The invocation cache can also be purged manually using the <a href="remote-management.html#HTTP%20API">HTTP API</a>.</p>

<p>The cache is not persisted. It will be lost when the application is stopped.</p>

<p>Cached invocations are <strong>not</strong> purged when the script file is auto-reloaded, such as in response to a change. If, while the application is running, you modify the script file in a way that would change a return value based on the same request context, you should either purge the invocation cache or restart.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="Logging">Logging</h2>

<p>Delegate methods may access a logger that writes to the application log:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'java'

logger = Java::edu.illinois.library.cantaloupe.script.Logger
logger.trace('Hello world')
logger.debug('Hello world')
logger.info('Hello world')
logger.warn('Hello world')
logger.error('Hello world')
{% endhighlight %}

<hr>

<h2 id="Testing Delegate Methods">Testing Delegate Methods</h2>

<p>Delegate methods can be tested by creating an instance of the <code>CustomDelegate</code> class, setting its context to be similar to what the application would set it to, and calling a method:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
# This file is named `test.rb`, in the same folder as `delegates.rb`
require './delegates'

obj = CustomDelegate.new
obj.context = {
  'identifier' => 'identifier-to-test',
  'client_ip' => '127.0.0.1',
  'request_headers' => ...
}

puts obj.filesystemresolver_pathname
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This script can then be run on the command line with a command like: <code>ruby test.rb</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>ruby</code> command will normally invoke the standard ("MRI") Ruby interpreter, and not the JRuby interpreter. While they mostly work the same, one thing to be aware of is that <em>gems with platform-native extensions won't work in JRuby</em>. Consider installing a standalone <a href="http://jruby.org">JRuby interpreter</a> and test with that instead. (Something like <a href="http://rvm.io/">RVM</a> can make it easier to switch between different versions of the Ruby interpreter.)</p>
