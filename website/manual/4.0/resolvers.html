<p>Resolvers provide access to source images. A resolver translates an identifier in a request URL to a source image locator, such as a pathname, in the particular type of underlying storage it is written to interface with. It can then check whether the underlying object exists and is accessible, and if so, provide access to it to other image server components. The rest of the image server does not need to know where an image resides, be it on the filesystem, on a remote web server, or wherever&mdash;it can just ask the resolver, whatever it may be, to provide a generic interface from which an image can be read.</p>

<p>The interface in question may be a stream or a file. All resolvers can provide stream access, but only <a href="#FilesystemResolver">FilesystemResolver</a> can provide file access. This distinction is important because <a href="processors.html#Retrieval%20Strategies">not all processors can read from streams</a>. See <a href="images.html#Considerations">Image Considerations</a> for background on why this is an issue.</p>

<h2 id="Selection">Selection</h2>

<p>In a typical configuration, <a href="#Static%20Resolver">one resolver will handle all requests</a>. It is also possible to <a href="#Dynamic%20Resolvers">select a resolver dynamically</a> depending on the image identifier.</p>

<h3 id="Static Resolver">Static Resolver</h2>

<p>When the <code>resolver.static</code> configuration key is set to the name of a resolver, that resolver will be used for all requests.</p>

<h3 id="Dynamic Resolvers">Dynamic Resolvers</h2>

<p>When a static resolver is not flexible enough, it is also possible to serve images from different sources simultaneously. For example, you may have some images stored on a filesystem, and others stored on Amazon S3. <em>If you can differentiate their sources based on their identifier in code</em>&mdash;either by analyzing the identifier string, or performing some kind of service request&mdash;you can use the <a href="delegate-script.html">delegate script</a> mechanism to write a simple Ruby method to tell the image server which resolver to use for a given request.</p>

<p>To enable dynamic resolver selection, set the <code>resolver.delegate</code> configuration key to <code>true</code>. Then, implement the <code>get_resolver(identifier)</code> method in the delegate script, which takes an identifier argument and returns a resolver name. For example:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
class CustomDelegate
  def resolver
    identifier = context['identifier']

    # Here, you would perform some kind of analysis on `identifier`:
    # parse it, look it up in a web service or database...
    # and then return the name of the resolver to use to serve it.
    'FilesystemResolver'
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>See the <a href="delegate-script.html">Delegate Script</a> section for general information about the delegate script.</p>

<h3 id="FilesystemResolver">FilesystemResolver</h3>

<p>FilesystemResolver maps a URL identifier to a filesystem path, for retrieving images on a local or attached filesystem. In addition to being the most compatible resolver, <strong>this is also the most efficient resolver</strong> and may be the only option for serving very large source images.</p>

<p>For images with extensions that are missing or unrecognized, this resolver will check the "magic number" to determine type, which will add some overhead. It is therefore slightly more efficient to serve images with extensions.</p>

<h4>Lookup Strategies</h4>

<p>FilesystemResolver supports two distinct lookup strategies, defined by the <code>FilesystemResolver.lookup_strategy</code> configuration option.</p>

<h5 id="FilesystemResolverBasicLookupStrategy">BasicLookupStrategy</h5>

<p>BasicLookupStrategy locates images by concatenating a pre-defined path prefix and/or suffix. For example, with the following configuration options set:</p>

{% highlight properties %}
# Note trailing slash!
FilesystemResolver.BasicLookupStrategy.path_prefix = /usr/local/images/
FilesystemResolver.BasicLookupStrategy.path_suffix =
{% endhighlight %}

<p>An identifier of <code>image.jpg</code> in the URL will resolve to
<span class="filename">/usr/local/images/image.jpg</span>.</p>

<p>It's also possible to include a partial path in the identifier using URL-encoded slashes (<code>%2F</code>) as path separators. <code>subdirectory%2Fimage.jpg</code> in the URL would then resolve to <span class="filename">/usr/local/images/subdirectory/image.jpg</span>.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">If you are operating behind a reverse proxy that is not capable of passing encoded URL characters through without decoding them, see the <code>slash_substitude</code> configuration key.</div>

<p>To prevent arbitrary directory traversal, BasicLookupStrategy will strip out <code>../</code>, <code>/..</code>, <code>..\</code>, and <code>\..</code> from identifiers before resolving the path.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">It may be dangerous to <strong>not</strong> use <code>path_prefix</code>. The shallower the path, the more of the filesystem that will be exposed.</div>

<h5 id="FilesystemResolverScriptLookupStrategy">ScriptLookupStrategy</h5>

<p>Sometimes, BasicLookupStrategy will not offer enough control. Perhaps you want to serve images from multiple filesystems, or perhaps your identifiers are opaque and you need to perform a database or web service request to locate the corresponding images. With this lookup strategy, you can tell FilesystemResolver to invoke a method in your <a href="delegate-script.html">delegate script</a> and capture the pathname it returns.</p>

<p>The delegate script method, <code>get_pathname(identifier)</code>, will take in an identifier string and should return a pathname, if available, or <code>nil</code>, if not. (See the <a href="delegate-script.html">Delegate Script</a> section for general information about the delegate script.) Examples follow:</p>

<h5>Example 1: Query a PostgreSQL database to find the pathname corresponding to a given identifier</h5>

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'java'

java_import 'org.postgresql.Driver'
java_import 'java.sql.DriverManager'

class CustomDelegate

  JDBC_URL = 'jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase'
  JDBC_USER = 'myuser'
  JDBC_PASSWORD = 'mypassword'

  # DriverManager is actually java.sql.DriverManager
  # (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/DriverManager.html);
  # we are calling Java API via JRuby.
  # By making the connection static, we can avoid reconnecting every time
  # get_pathname() is called, which would be slow and expensive.
  @@conn = DriverManager.get_connection(JDBC_URL, JDBC_USER, JDBC_PASSWORD)

  def filesystemresolver_pathname
    identifier = context['identifier']
    begin
      # Note the use of prepared statements, which are safer than
      # string concatenation.
      sql = 'SELECT pathname FROM images WHERE identifier = ? LIMIT 1'
      stmt = @@conn.prepare_statement(sql)
      stmt.set_string(1, identifier.to_s)
      results = stmt.execute_query
      results.next
      pathname = results.getString(1)
      return (pathname.length > 0) ? pathname : nil
    ensure
      stmt.close if stmt
    end
  end

end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Note that several common Ruby database libraries (like the mysql and pgsql gems) use native extensions. These won't work in JRuby. Instead, the course of action above is to use the JDBC API via the JRuby-Java bridge. For this to work, a JDBC driver for your database will need to be installed on the Java classpath, and referenced in a <code>java_import</code> statement.</p>

<h5>Example 2: Query a web service to find the pathname corresponding to a given identifier</h5>

<p>This very simple imaginary web service will return a pathname in the response body if an image was found, and an empty response body if not.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'net/http'
require 'cgi'

class CustomDelegate
  def filesystemresolver_pathname
    identifier = context['identifier']
    uri = 'http://example.org/webservice/' + CGI.escape(identifier)
    uri = URI.parse(uri)

    http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
    request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.request_uri)
    response = http.request(request)
    return nil if response.code.to_i >= 400

    (response.body.length > 0) ? response.body.strip : nil
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="HttpResolver">HttpResolver</h3>

<p>HttpResolver maps a URL identifier to an HTTP or HTTPS resource, for retrieving images from a web server. HttpResolver uses a <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/http-client.html">Jetty HTTP client</a> internally and supports HTTP/1.1 and optional Basic authentication.</p>

<h4>Format Inference</h4>

<p>Like all resolvers, HttpResolver needs to be able to figure out the format of a source image before it can be served. It uses the following strategy to do this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the source image's identifier has a recognized filename extension, the format will be inferred from that.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, a <code>GET</code> request will be sent with a <code>Range</code> header specifying a small range of data from the beginning of the resource.
    <ol>
      <li>If a <code>Content-Type</code> header is present in the response, and is specific enough (i.e. not <code>application/octet-stream</code>), a format will be inferred from that.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, a format will be inferred from the magic bytes in the response body.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If none of the above are successful, an error response will be returned.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Lookup Strategies</h4>

<p>HttpResolver supports two distinct lookup strategies, defined by the <code>HttpResolver.lookup_strategy</code> configuration option.</p>

<h5 id="HttpResolverBasicLookupStrategy">BasicLookupStrategy</h5>

<p>BasicLookupStrategy locates images by concatenating a pre-defined URL prefix and/or suffix. For example, with the following configuration options set:</p>

{% highlight properties %}
# Note trailing slash!
HttpResolver.BasicLookupStrategy.url_prefix = http://example.org/images/
HttpResolver.BasicLookupStrategy.url_suffix =
{% endhighlight %}

<p>An identifier of <code>image.jpg</code> in the URL will resolve to
<span class="filename">http://example.org/images/image.jpg</span>.</p>

<p>It's also possible to include a partial path in the identifier using URL-encoded slashes (<code>%2F</code>) as path separators. <code>subdirectory%2Fimage.jpg</code> in the URL would then resolve to <span class="filename">http://example.org/images/subdirectory/image.jpg</span>.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">If you are operating behind a reverse proxy that is not capable of passing encoded URL characters through without decoding them, see the <code>slash_substitude</code> configuration key.</div>

<h5 id="HttpResolverScriptLookupStrategy">ScriptLookupStrategy</h5>

<p>Sometimes, BasicLookupStrategy will not offer enough control. Perhaps you want to serve images from multiple URLs, or perhaps your identifiers are opaque and you need to run a database or web service request to locate them.  With this lookup strategy, you can tell HttpResolver to invoke a method in your <a href="delegate-script.html">delegate script</a> and capture the URL it returns.</p>

<p>The delegate script method, <code>get_url(identifier)</code>, will take in an identifier string and should return a URL, if available, or <code>nil</code>, if not. See the <a href="delegate-script.html">Delegate Script</a> section for general information about the delegate script, and the <a href="#FilesystemResolverScriptLookupStrategy">FilesystemResolver ScriptLookupStrategy</a> section for examples of similar scripts.</p>

<h4>Authentication</h1>

<p>HTTP Basic authentication is supported.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When using <a href="#HttpResolverBasicLookupStrategy">BasicLookupStrategy</a>, auth info is set globally in the <code>HttpResolver.auth.basic.username</code> and <code>HttpResolver.auth.basic.secret</code> configuration keys.</li>
  <li>When using <a href="#HttpResolverScriptLookupStrategy">ScriptLookupStrategy</a>, auth info can be returned from the delegate method.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3 id="JdbcResolver">JdbcResolver</h3>

<p>JdbcResolver maps a URL identifier to a BLOB field, for retrieving images from a relational database. It does not require a custom schema and can adapt to any schema. The downside of that is that some <a href="delegate-script.html">delegate script</a> methods must be implemented in order to obtain the information needed to run the SQL queries.</p>

<p>Cantaloupe does not include any JDBC drivers, so a driver JAR for the desired database must be obtained separately and saved somewhere on the classpath.</p>

<p>The JDBC connection is initialized by the <code>JdbcResolver.url</code>, <code>JdbcResolver.user</code>, and <code>JdbcResolver.password</code> configuration options. If the user or password are not necessary, they can be left blank. The connection string must use your driver's JDBC syntax:</p>

<pre><code>jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/my_database
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/my_database
jdbc:microsoft:sqlserver://example.org:1433;DatabaseName=MY_DATABASE</code></pre>

<p>Consult the driver's documentation for details.</p>

<p>Then, the resolver needs to be told:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#JdbcResolverIdentifierMethod">The database value corresponding to a given identifier</a></li>
  <li><a href="#JdbcResolverMediaTypeMethod">The media type corresponding to that value</a></li>
  <li><a href="#JdbcResolverBlobSQLMethod">The SQL statement that retrieves the BLOB value corresponding to that value</a></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="JdbcResolverIdentifierMethod">Database Identifier Retrieval Method</h4>

<p>This method takes in an unencoded URL identifier and returns the corresponding database value of the identifier.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
class CustomDelegate
  def jdbcresolver_database_identifier
    # If URL identifiers map directly to values in the database, simply
    # return the identifier from the request context. Otherwise, you
    # could transform it, perform a service request to look it up, etc.
    context['identifier']
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h4 id="JdbcResolverMediaTypeMethod">Media Type Retrieval Method</h4>

<p>This method returns a media (MIME) type corresponding to the value returned by the <code><a href="#JdbcResolverIdentifierMethod">get_database_identifier</a></code> method. If the media type is stored in the database, this example will return an SQL statement to retrieve it.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
class CustomDelegate
  def jdbcresolver_media_type
    'SELECT media_type ' +
        'FROM some_table ' +
        'WHERE some_identifier = ?'
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If the URL identifier will <strong>always</strong> have a known, valid image extension, like <span class="filename">.jpg</span>, <span class="filename">.tif</span>, etc., this method can return <code>nil</code>, and Cantaloupe will infer the media type from the extension.</p>

<h4 id="JdbcResolverBlobSQLMethod">BLOB Retrieval SQL Method</h4>

<p>The <code>get_lookup_sql</code> method returns an SQL statement that selects the BLOB value corresponding to the value returned by the <code><a href="#JdbcResolverIdentifierMethod">get_database_identifier</a></code> method.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
class CustomDelegate
  def jdbcresolver_lookup_sql
    'SELECT image_blob_column '
        'FROM some_table '
        'WHERE some_identifier = ?'
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<hr>

<h3 id="S3Resolver">S3Resolver</h3>

<p>S3Resolver (previously named AmazonS3Resolver) maps a URL identifier to an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> object, for retrieving images from S3. S3Resolver can work with Amazon S3, but is not coupled to it&mdash;it can work with other S3 endpoints as well.</p>

<h4>Configuration</h4>

<p>S3Resolver is configured (excepting credentials) using the following configuation keys:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>S3Resolver.endpoint</code></dt>
  <dd>URI or hostname of an S3 endpont. For AWS endpoints, this will be a value like <code>s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com</code>. (See the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region">list of AWS S3 Regions</a>.)</dd>
  <dt><code>S3Resolver.bucket.name</code></dt>
  <dd>Name of the bucket containing the images to be served.</dd>
  <dt><code>S3Resolver.lookup_strategy</code></dt>
  <dd>The strategy to use to look up images based on their URL identifier. See <a href="#S3ResolverLookupStrategies">Lookup Strategies</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="S3ResolverCredentialsSources">Credentials Sources</h4>

<p>S3Resolver can obtain its credentials from several different sources. It will search each one in order and use the first that it finds:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Configuration File</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Credentials can be set via the following keys in the configuration file:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>S3Resolver.access_key_id</code></dt>
      <dd>An access key associated with your AWS account. (See <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/security-credentials">AWS Security Credentials</a>.)</dd>
      <dt><code>S3Resolver.secret_key</code></dt>
      <dd>A secret key associated with your AWS account. (See <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/security-credentials">AWS Security Credentials</a>.)</dd>
    </dl>
  </dt>
  <dt>Environment Variables</dt>
  <dd>Credentials are read from the <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> (or <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY</code>) and <code>AWS_SECRET_KEY</code> (or <code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code>) environment variables. If the <code>AWS_SESSION_TOKEN</code> environment variable is also set, then temporary credentials will be used.</dd>
  <dt>VM Arguments</dt>
  <dd>Credentials are provided via the <code>aws.accessKeyId</code> and <code>aws.secretKey</code> VM arguments.</dd>
  <dt>AWS Configuration Profile</dt>
  <dd>Credentials are provided by the profile configuration file for the default profile.</dd>
  <dt>Instance Profile</dt>
  <dd>Credentials are loaded from the Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Format Inference</h4>

<p>Like all resolvers, S3Resolver needs to be able to figure out the format of a source image before it can be served. It uses the following strategy to do this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the object key has a recognized filename extension, the format will be inferred from that.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, if the source image's URI identifier has a recognized filename extension, the format will be inferred from that.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, a <code>GET</code> request will be sent with a <code>Range</code> header specifying a small range of data from the beginning of the resource.
    <ol>
      <li>If a <code>Content-Type</code> header is present in the response, and is specific enough (i.e. not <code>application/octet-stream</code>), a format will be inferred from that.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, a format will be inferred from the magic bytes in the response body.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If none of the above are successful, an error response will be returned.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="S3ResolverLookupStrategies">Lookup Strategies</h4>

<h5 id="S3ResolverBasicLookupStrategy">BasicLookupStrategy</h5>

<p>BasicLookupStrategy locates images by passing the URL identifier as-is to S3, with no additional configuration necessary or possible.</p>

<h5 id="S3ResolverScriptLookupStrategy">ScriptLookupStrategy</h5>

<p>When your URL identifiers don't match your Amazon S3 object keys, ScriptLookupStrategy is available to tell S3Resolver to capture the object key returned by a method in your <a href="delegate-script.html">delegate script</a>.</p>

<p>The delegate script method, <code>get_s3_object_key(identifier)</code>, will take in an identifier string and should return an S3 object key string, if available, or <code>nil</code>, if not. See the <a href="delegate-script.html">Delegate Script</a> section for general information about the delegate script, and the <a href="#FilesystemResolverScriptLookupStrategy">FilesystemResolver ScriptLookupStrategy</a> section for an example of a similar script.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="AzureStorageResolver">AzureStorageResolver</h3>

<p>AzureStorageResolver maps a URL identifier to a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/">Microsoft Azure Storage</a> blob, for retrieving images from Azure Storage. It can be configured with the following options:</p>

<h4>Configuration</h4>

<dl>
  <dt><code>AzureStorageResolver.account_name</code></dt>
  <dd>The name of your Azure account.</dd>
  <dt><code>AzureStorageResolver.account_key</code></dt>
  <dd>A key to access your Azure Storage account.</dd>
  <dt><code>AzureStorageResolver.container_name</code></dt>
  <dd>Name of the container from which to serve images.</dd>
  <dt><code>AzureStorageResolver.lookup_strategy</code></dt>
  <dd>The strategy to use to look up images based on their URL identifier. See below.</dd>
</dl>

<p>As of version 4.0, this resolver also supports <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1#how-a-shared-access-signature-works">shared access signatures</a> as an alternative to hard-coding the account name, account key, and container name.</p>

<h4>Format Inference</h4>

<p>Like all resolvers, AzureStorageResolver needs to be able to figure out the format of a source image before it can be served. It uses the following strategy to do this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the blob key has a recognized filename extension, the format will be inferred from that.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, if the source image's URI identifier has a recognized filename extension, the format will be inferred from that.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, a <code>HEAD</code> request will be sent. If a <code>Content-Type</code> header is present in the response, and is specific enough (i.e. not <code>application/octet-stream</code>), a format will be inferred from that.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, a <code>GET</code> request will be sent with a <code>Range</code> header specifying a small range of data from the beginning of the resource, and a format will be inferred from the magic bytes in the response body.</li>
  <li>If none of the above are successful, an error response will be returned.</li>
</ol>
