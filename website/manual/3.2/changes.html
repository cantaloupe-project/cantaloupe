<h2>What's New in <span class="version">3.2</span></h2>

<h2>3.2</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All processors that use the Java 2D pipeline (Java2dProcessor, KakaduProcessor, OpenJpegProcessor, PdfBoxProcessor) support selectable upscaling and downscaling filters.</li>
  <li>All processors offer configurable sharpening.</li>
  <li>Added the ability to embed ICC color profiles in derivative images.</li>
  <li>Added the ability to copy EXIF, IPTC IIM, XMP, and/or native TIFF and PNG metadata from source images to derivative images of the same format, for some processors.</li>
  <li>Improved the scale quality of JaiProcessor.</li>
  <li>Java2dProcessor and JaiProcessor respect the value of an embedded EXIF Orientation tag.</li>
  <li>Increased the default Java2dProcessor/JaiProcessor JPEG output quality to 0.8 (80).</li>
  <li>Added support for the <code>X-IIIF-ID</code> proxy header, in order to return correct image identifiers in information responses whose requests have passed through a reverse proxy using a different identifier.</li>
  <li>Removed the JAI post-processor for KakaduProcessor and OpenJpegProcessor.</li>
  <li>HTTP 415 is returned instead of HTTP 400 when an output format is requested that is valid but unsupported by the current processor.</li>
  <li>HTTP 400 is returned in response to a request for an image that would be zero pixels on a side, even when the zero dimension was not explicit in the request (for example, a size of <code>4,</code> for an image that is at least five times wider than it is tall). (Previously, it was only returned when zero pixels was explicitly requested, and the returned image was incorrect.)</li>
  <li>Upgraded a number of libraries.</li>
</ul>
