<h2>Source Formats</h2>

Various Cantaloupe processors support several other formats than those listed here; what follows are mainly just notes.</p>

<h3 id="JPEG">JPEG</h3>

<p>It should be possible to use TurboJPEG (high-level API over <a href="http://www.libjpeg-turbo.org">libjpeg-turbo</a>) with Java2dProcessor to hardware-accelerate JPEG coding. To do so, include the <a href="https://github.com/geosolutions-it/imageio-ext/wiki/TurboJPEG-plugin">TurboJPEG plugin JAR</a> in your classpath, and compile libjpeg-turbo with Java support (using the <code>--with-java</code>
configuration option). (The author has not tried this.)</p>

<h3 id="JPEG2000">JPEG2000</h3>

<p>JPEG2000 uses advanced compression techniques to enable fast reduced-scale and region-of-interest decoding. In theory, and with a performant decoder, JPEG2000 is well-suited for extremely large source images.</p>

<p><a href="processors.html#KakaduProcessor">KakaduProcessor</a> is by far the most efficient processor for this format, and it performs very well, even with images in the range of hundreds of megapixels.</p>

<p><a href="processors.html#OpenJpegProcessor">OpenJpegProcessor</a> uses the OpenJPEG decoder, which is generally considered, as of this writing, to be the fastest open-source JPEG2000 decoder. (<a href="processors.html#ImageMagickProcessor">ImageMagickProcessor</a>'s JPEG2000 delegate, if installed, will also use the OpenJPEG library, but less efficiently as it won't use OpenJPEG's level reduction feature.)</p>

<p><a href="processors.html#GraphicsMagickProcessor">GraphicsMagickProcessor</a> can read and write JPEG2000 using JasPer, if the necessary plugin is installed. This will probably not be fast enough to be usable for most purposes.</p>

<p>See <a href="processors.html#JaiProcessor">JaiProcessor</a> for notes on the mediaLib accelerator.</p>

<h3 id="TIFF">TIFF</h3>

<p>Most processors can read this format, though some have trouble with its special cases. Additionally, there are some conditions that TIFF images must meet in order to be delivered efficiently&mdash;read on for details.</p>

<h4>Strip-Based vs. Tile-Based</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/tiff/TIFF6.pdf">Adobe TIFF 6.0 specification</a> permits arrangements of image data in either strips or tiles. Most TIFF encoders produce strip-based TIFFs unless told to do otherwise. These work fine at small sizes, but are increasingly slow to read as size increases. <strong>High-resolution TIFFs must be tile-based</strong> in order to permit efficient region extraction. An easy way to check is with the <span class="filename">tiffdump</span> utility:</p>

<pre>$ tiffdump image.tif</pre>

<p>For strip-based TIFFs, this will print out some information including <code>StripOffsets</code>, <code>StripByteCounts</code>, and so on. For tile-based TIFFs, it will print <code>TileOffsets</code>, <code>TileByteCounts</code>, and so on, instead.</p>

<h4>Multi-Resolution (Pyramidal) TIFF</h4>

<p>Multi-resolution TIFF is a special type of TIFF file that can improve reader efficiency at reduced scales. In addition to the main image, a multi-resolution TIFF file will contain a sequence of progressively half-sized sub-images: for example, a 10000&times;10000 pixel main image would include derivatives of 5000&times;5000 pixels, 2500&times;2500 pixels, 1250&times;1250 pixels, and so on, all embedded inside the same file.</p>

<p>Each of the levels in a multi-resolution TIFF file is, itself, a TIFF image that can be striped or tiled just like a mono-resolution TIFF file. Tiled and pyramidal encoding are complementary: the former improves efficiency with reduced regions at large scales, and the latter improves efficiency at reduced scales.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>For efficient deep zooming, TIFF images need to be pyramidal, and each level of the pyramid should be tiled. The reduced-scale pyramid levels will be used at small scales (shallow zoom levels), while the tiles of the large-scale levels will be used at large scales.</p>

<p><a href="processors.html#Java2dProcessor">Java2dProcessor</a> and <a href="processors.html#JaiProcessor">JaiProcessor</a> both support multi-resolution TIFF, which is to say that they actually do read the embedded sub-images and choose the smallest one that can fulfill the request. Java2dProcessor additionally exploits tiled sub-images, for the best of both worlds.</p>
