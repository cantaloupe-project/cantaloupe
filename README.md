# Developers

## Build & run

### Command line

* `cp cantaloupe.properties.sample cantaloupe.properties` then edit cantaloupe.properties per your needs.
* `mvn clean compile exec:java -Dcantaloupe.config=cantaloupe.properties` will build and run the
  project using the embedded web server listening on the port(s) specified in
  `cantaloupe.properties`.
* `mvn clean package -DskipTests` will build a release JAR in the `target`
  folder, which can be run via:

  `java -cp cantaloupe-{version}.jar -Dcantaloupe.config=... edu.illinois.library.cantaloupe.StandaloneEntry`

### IDE

1. Add a new run configuration using the "Java Application" template or
   similar.
2. Set the main class to `edu.illinois.library.cantaloupe.StandaloneEntry` and
   add the `-Dcantaloupe.config=cantaloupe.properties` VM option.

## Test

### Testing the code

Copy `test.properties.sample` to `test.properties` and fill in whatever info
you have.

The code tests are structured into three Maven profiles:

#### 1. Tests with no dependencies

`mvn clean test -Pnodeps` will run only the tests that have no dependencies
on third-party services and do not require any external tools or libraries.

#### 2. Tests with free dependencies

`mvn clean test -Pfreedeps` will run all of the above tests, plus any that
depend on open-source tools or libraries. These are the tests run in
continuous integration. The following dependencies are required:

* MinIO (for S3SourceTest & S3CacheTest)
* FFmpeg (for FfmpegProcessorTest)
* Grok (for GrokProcessorTest)
* OpenJPEG (for OpenJpegProcessorTest)
* TurboJPEG with Java binding (for TurboJpegProcessorTest)
* Redis (for RedisCacheTest)

#### 3. All tests

`mvn clean test` will run all tests including the ones above. The following
additional dependencies are required:

* Kakadu native library (for KakaduNativeProcessorTest) - see the
  KakaduNativeProcessor section of the user manual for information.
* A Microsoft Azure account

#### Docker

Because it can be a chore to install all of the dependencies needed to get all
of the tests in the `freedeps` profile passing, there is a `docker-compose.yml`
file available that will spin up all needed dependencies in separate
containers, and run the tests in another container. From the project root
directory, invoke:

  `docker-compose -f docker/{platform}/docker-compose.yml up --build --exit-code-from cantaloupe`.

### Output testing

There is an [output tester tool](https://github.com/cantaloupe-project/output-tester)
that enables visual inspection of image output.

### Performance testing

Performance tests use [JMH](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/).
Run them with `mvn clean test -Pbenchmark`.

## Contribute

The suggested process for contributing code changes is:

1. Submit a "heads-up" issue in the tracker, ideally before beginning any
   work.
2. [Create a fork.](https://github.com/cantaloupe-project/cantaloupe/fork)
3. Create a feature branch, starting from either `release/x.x` or `develop`
   (see the "Versioning" section.)
4. Make your changes.
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
6. Push the branch (`git push origin feature/my-new-feature`).
7. Create a pull request.

## Other Notes

### Configuration keys

Different application versions may require different configuration file keys.
It's good practice to use a dedicated configuration file for each version.
Key changes are documented in
[UPGRADING.md](https://github.com/cantaloupe-project/cantaloupe/blob/develop/UPGRADING.md).

### Versioning

Cantaloupe roughly uses semantic versioning. Major releases (n) involve major
redesign that breaks backwards compatibility significantly. Minor releases
(n.n) either do not break compatibility, or only in a minor way. Patch releases
(n.n.n) are for bugfixes only.

### Branching

Cantaloupe uses a basic version of the
[Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow)
branching model. `develop` is the main branch that tracks the current state of
the next non-bugfix release. Significant features branch off of that into
feature branches (`feature/feature-name`), from which they can be integrated
into a particular release.

When a major or minor version in `develop` is ready for release, it merges into
a `release/n.n` branch, where the release is tagged and the release archive is
created.

Bugfixes that would increment a minor version of a release are applied to its
release branch and merged back into `develop`.

## Prerelease

1. Run the Maven Verifier plugin (`mvn verify -DskipTests=true`)
2. Run an OWASP dependency check (`mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check`)
3. Run Spotbugs (`mvn clean compile spotbugs:spotbugs spotbugs:gui`)
4. Run the [Endpoint tests](https://github.com/cantaloupe-project/output-tester)
5. Finalize the code to be released, addressing any relevant milestone issues,
   TODOs, etc.
6. Finalize the documentation, including the website, user manual, and change
   log

## Releasing

1. Merge into `release/vX.X`
2. Update the version in `pom.xml` and commit this change
3. `git push origin release/x.x`
4. Wait for CI tests to pass
5. Tag the release: `git tag -a v{version} -m 'Tag v{version}'; git push --tags`
6. Wait for GitHub Actions to add the release artifact to the tag
7. Add the change log to the release on GitHub
8. Close the release's issue milestone
9. Deploy the updated
    [website](https://github.com/cantaloupe-project/cantaloupe-project.github.io)
    (if necessary)
